Members of the Cabinet of the United States in the Biden administration will assume office after the inauguration of President Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, and after confirmation by the United States Senate. In addition to the 15 heads of executive departments, there will be nine Cabinet-level officials, with three positions being elevated to Cabinet-level, and one position being dropped. Confirmations have occurred at the slowest pace of any presidential cabinet in modern history.
All permanent members of the Cabinet of the United States as heads of executive departments require the advice and consent of the United States Senate following appointment by the president before taking office. The vice presidency is exceptional in that the position requires an election to office pursuant to the United States Constitution. The president may also designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as Cabinet-level members of the Cabinet. The Cabinet meets with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office.
The following have been named as Cabinet appointees by the president of the United States.
Below is a list of confirmations for Cabinet positions, Cabinet-level positions, and other significant positions that were approved through the Senate from January 2021 onwards, by a recorded roll-call vote, rather than by a voice vote.
On November 7, 2020, it was announced that Democrat Joe Biden defeated the incumbent president, Donald Trump, in the 2020 presidential election. Joe Biden received 306 electoral votes compared to Trump's 232 electoral votes, with 270 needed to win the presidency. He assumed office on January 20, 2021.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) was elected vice president of the United States, receiving 306 electoral votes, compared to the incumbent vice president, Mike Pence, who received 232 electoral votes. An elected vice president does not require Senate confirmation, and the vice president does not serve at the president's pleasure.  Having assumed office on January 20, 2021, she is the first female vice president of the United States as well as the first African American and Asian American to hold the second-highest office.

Speed skiing is the sport of skiing downhill in a straight line at as high a speed as possible, as timed over a fixed stretch of ski slope. While training for the 1956 Winter Olympics, American downhiller Ralph Miller is credited with being the first to break 100 mph (161 km/h), at nearly 109 mph (175 km/h) in August 1955 at Portillo, Chile, a record which held up for fifteen years. In 1978, also at Portillo, American Steve McKinney's record-breaking run of 200.2 km/h (124.4 mph) made him the first to break the 200 km/h (124.3 mph) barrier. The first 300 or 400 m (980 or 1,310 ft) of the course (the launching area) is used to gain speed, the top speed is measured in the next 100 m (330 ft) (the timing zone) and the last 500 m (1,600 ft) (the run-out area) is used for slowing down and coming to a stop. In theory, speeds could continue to increase by using even longer and steeper slopes; this eventually changes speed skiing into something closer to skydiving except with skis rather than a parachute.

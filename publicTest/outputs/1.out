Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader, never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. Despite their success in their ability to have a career and Impressionism's demise attributed to its allegedly feminine characteristics (its sensuality, dependence on sensation, physicality, and fluidity) the four women artists (and other, lesser-known women Impressionists) were largely omitted from art historical textbooks covering Impressionist artists until Tamar Garb's Women Impressionists published in 1986. The central figures in the development of Impressionism in France, listed alphabetically, were: Frédéric Bazille (1841–1870), who only posthumously participated in the Impressionist exhibitions Gustave Caillebotte (1848–1894), who, younger than the others, joined forces with them in the mid-1870s Mary Cassatt (1844–1926), American-born, she lived in Paris and participated in four Impressionist exhibitions Paul Cézanne (1839–1906), although he later broke away from the Impressionists Edgar Degas (1834–1917), who despised the term Impressionist Armand Guillaumin (1841–1927) Édouard Manet (1832–1883), who did not participate in any of the Impressionist exhibitions Claude Monet (1840–1926), the most prolific of the Impressionists and the one who embodies their aesthetic most obviously Berthe Morisot (1841–1895) who participated in all Impressionist exhibitions except in 1879 Camille Pissarro  (1830–1903) Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841–1919), who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1874, 1876, 1877 and 1882. These include Jean-Louis Forain (who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1886) and Giuseppe De Nittis, an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work.
